<h1><a href='./mobile'>middCalendar</a></h1>
<p>middCalendar was designed and implemented by Sebastian Matt, Greg Krathwohl, Gilbert Kipkorir, and Wilder Schaaf for CS 1002 Web Database Systems during J-term 2014. We and six other groups were given the challenge of creating a new student event calendar. The full application supports logging in, creating organizations, and adding events. This site has been slimmed and styled down to just a calendar. Events are pulled directly from the Middlebury College Featured Events feed, but can also be submitted through our main application, go/MiddEvents. </p>
