Database stuff:

-- let location and description be longer
-- change event primary key from an autoincremented number to name, date, and time. Especially if we start automatically adding events, don't want to allow duplicates.


php/html:

-- make it pretty
-- fix fields of autogenerated events
-- finish jquery filtering
-- clean and comment code
