Database stuff:

-- let location and description be longer
-- change event primary key from an autoincremented number to name, date, and time. Especially if we start automatically adding events, don't want to allow duplicates.

-- for events, featured = 0/1?


php/html:

-- view by dates. search by date or look at events beyond a week

-- make it pretty
-- fix fields of autogenerated events
-- finish jquery filtering
-- clean and comment code

-- let event creators edit certain parts of an event? (time, additional info)
-- more admin options? (disapprove event)
-- featured events? (random or selected by an admin)


crontab:

-- delete events older than 1 year or something
-- fetch new events from rss feed
-- send emails to people who subscribe?
-- backup events/users?
